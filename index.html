<h3>Artist Statement: I created this art piece with one sole reason:  To have fun.  With many of the art pieces we see and learn about, a lot of them
  have an important, meaningful message.  Comparable to Dadaism, I look to lightly challenge that.  Why can't art just be made just
  to be art?  Why can't it just exist where ever it may be?  I created this art piece to just be something that's just there with no
  deeper meaning, just fun.</h3>
